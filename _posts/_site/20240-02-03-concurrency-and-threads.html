<h2 id="threads">Threads</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each thread is like an independent worker, but they all <strong>share the same memory space</strong>.</li>
  <li>Each thread has its own <strong>program counter(PC)</strong> to keeps track of where a thread is in its execution.</li>
  <li>Just like a process has a control block to <strong>keep track of its state</strong>, each thread has its own <strong>Thread Control Block(TCB)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
