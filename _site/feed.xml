      Storage Abstractions

Storage virtualization is based on two main ideas: the file and the directory.


  File: A group of bytes that can be read or written. Each file has a low-level name in the form of an inode number.
  Directory: the user-readable name and the low-level name are listed in pairs.


A file system consists of groups of directories and the files and other directories they contai...

      What is RAID?


  A hardware RAID is a computer system designed to manage a set of disks.
  RAID technology has three basic functions:
    
      Block access to data is achieved by striping the data on the disk, reducing the mechanical seek time and increasing data access speed.
      Reading multiple disks in an array reduces mechanical seek time and increases data access speed at the same ti...

The objects that CPU handles that are not memory, and are connected to a computer system. e.g.


  SSD
  Keyboard
  Network


The Bus

A bus is a system for transferring data between components inside a computer or between computers.

      What is Hard Disk Drive?

Hard disk drives are persistent storage devices for computers.

Interface and Internal


  Interface: read and write.
    
      includes several sectors (512 -byte blocks) that each one can be read and write.
      It’s like an array of n sectors, with an address space ranging from 0 to n−1.
      Some types of interfaces: SCSI, SATA, and SAS.
    
  
  Internal:
